# Chordsheet CLI [![Maintenance](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-inactive-orange.svg)]()

A simple CLI to create chord sheets out of markdown files.

* If you're looking for an online chordsheet editor, check this out: [Chordsheet Editor](https://gldraphael.github.io/chordsheet-editor/)
* If you're intereseted in the generation of the preview markup, check this repo: [`gldraphael/chordsheet`](https://github.com/gldraphael/chordsheet)

**THIS REPO IS CURRENTLY NOT BEING MAINTAINED.**   
I do plan to update this in the future though.

## Installing chordsheet

Install `chordsheet-cli` globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g chordsheet-cli
```

You can now use it by typing `chordsheet` in your terminal.
